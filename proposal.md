# Reddit Smarter

### Background and Overview

Reddit Smarter is a data analytics tool for Reddit users to gain useful insight into trends on the social media platform.

When a user types the name of a subreddit into the search feature, Reddit Smarter will pull the most recent posts to that subreddit and plot the number of posts made by time of day, the average karma received on each post by time of day posted, and will allow users to query for certain keywords in post titles to see how posts with those keywords in the title perform compared to posts without the keywords.

Reddit limits the rate at which requests can be made to their API and the size of the requests that can be made, so Reddit Smarter will gather post information at the maximum rate allowed by the Reddit API, and will display the results as they are being received.

### Functionality and MVP

With Reddit Smarter, users will be able to:

* Enter a subreddit to search
* Enter a maximum number of posts to pull
* Pause the API from pulling additional posts
* View the results of the API pulls as they are happening
